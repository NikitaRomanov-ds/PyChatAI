**PyChatAi** is a Python module for generating responses from the OpenAI
GPT-3 language model.

This project was created by Nikita Romanov in 2023, based on the demand
for a simple and user-friendly interface to interact with the powerful
GPT-3 model.

This class provides an easy-to-use method for generating responses by
simply providing a question as an argument.

The generated response is then printed to the console.

Currently, GPT is maintained by Nikita Romanov as a standalone project.
